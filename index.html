                        <p>Fabric masks are recommended to prevent onward transmission in the general population in public areas, particularly where distancing is not possible, and in areas of community transmission. This could include the school grounds in some situations. Masks may help to protect others, because wearers may be infected before symptoms of illness appear. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering should be in line with national or local guidelines. Where used, masks should be worn, cared for and disposed of properly.</p>

                            Take care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.
                            Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
                            Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.</p>

                        <h3>avoid close contact with animals</h3>
                        <p>We do not know the exact source of the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but we know that it originally came from an animal, likely a bat.
                            At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to people.
                            Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
                            More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.
                            We are still learning about this virus, but we know that it can spread from people to animals in some situations, especially during close contact.
                            People with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should avoid contact with animals, including pets, livestock, and wildlife.</p>

                        <h3>avoid close contact with peoples</h3>
                        <p>Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
                            If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
                            Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.
                            Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
                            Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people.
                            Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</p>
